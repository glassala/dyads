# dyads

This is a personal/academic exercise by which to help familiarize
myself better with both algebra and Lean's type system. It defines assorted lemmas and
algebraic structures on the Bool type, along with a custom "Dyad" type whose
purpose is to demonstrate how the same structures emerge from any two-element type.

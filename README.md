# dyads

This is essentially a personal/academic exercise by which to help familiarize
myself better with both algebra and Lean's type system. It defines assorted lemmas and
algebraic structures on the Bool type, along with a custom "Dyad" type whose
purpose is to demonstrate how the same structures emerge from any two-element type.

Since the goal of this repository is demonstration, the comments and docstrings
are expected to grow over time, and proofs given by simp or by aesop are expected
to eventually be expanded and annotated wherever this is not tedious.
